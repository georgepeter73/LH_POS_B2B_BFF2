     * An Illinois Land Trust, is a unique legal entity with an overlay of statutory approval and constraints. In an Illinois Land Trust, the trustee holds both legal and equitable title to the real property in accordance with the trust agreement. The beneficiary or beneficiaries of the trust have no legal or equitable interest in the real property, but do have the right of possession, management, and control of the real property, as well as a right to the rents, profits and proceeds therefrom. This type of trust is only recognized in the states of:  Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia.

    /**
     * A land trust is a land ownership arrangement to manage complex divisions of the bundle of rights that people can own in real property, and can be used to manage something as large and complex as a multi-state real estate investment trust, or as common and small as a single-family home. A land trust may be private such as a land conservation trust, or more typically as an agreement whereby one party (the trustee) agrees to hold ownership of a piece of real property for the benefit of another party (the beneficiary). Land trusts are typically used to protect title and minimize taxes on real property. Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, and Virginia have statutes that permit forms of land trusts, while states such as Arizona, California and Ohio have permitted the creation of land trusts through court decisions. The majorities of states do not recognize, or permit the use of, land trusts. Land trusts are unique because the duties and powers of the trustee are limited, but they are still considered to be trusts and generally are governed by the principles that are applicable to all other trusts.
